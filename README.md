This deep learning project, developed for the University of Venice Ca' Foscari, aims to create a sophisticated neural network (NN) capable of identifying deepfake videos and images. Deepfakes, which involve the use of artificial intelligence to create highly realistic but fake content, pose significant challenges in terms of authenticity and security. This project addresses these challenges by leveraging advanced machine learning techniques to distinguish genuine media from manipulated content.

Our Objectives are:

1. Develop a robust neural network: Design and train a neural network model specifically optimized for detecting deepfake media.
2. Enhance media authentication: Provide a reliable tool to verify the authenticity of videos and images, contributing to digital media security and trustworthiness.
